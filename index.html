        <p>I am a junior developer with a strong education in programming, furthered by my recent partecipation and finalisation of a master's degree in full-stack development. While my previous work experience is focused on the textile sector, where I held merchandising roles for several years, I am eager to apply my technical skills and knowledge to software development. My background demonstrates my ability to adapt to diverse environments and my commitment to continuous learning. I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to grow as a professional and contribute enthusiastically to development projects.</p>
